        <p style="text-indent: 40px">Hello, my name is Craig Brunengraber, and I am a recent Momentum Learning bootcamp graduate who is focused on growing my tech career. Much like technology, I am adaptable and enjoy challenges that solve real world problems. My desire to code stems from insatiable curiosity, and a love of building and creating. My immediate career goals are to grow with a company that offers a product or service that matters in peoples lives, in a needed yet ever changing industry. I value honesty and integrity, as well as clear communication, and would expect that to align with any team I would join. I am always ready for new and fun challenges. I also love to communicate face to face, as a human connection can make any technology personified. </p>
